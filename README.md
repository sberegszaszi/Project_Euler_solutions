# Project Euler Solutions

### **WARNING!**
**Please do not look at the code if you are planning to solve any of these problems in the future. Don't deny yourself the learning opportunity that comes with working out the solutions on your own.**

## Description

This project contains my solutions to some of the Project Euler problems (https://projecteuler.net/about). The relevant code and .txt files containing the necessary data are located in each subfolder numbered according to the problem ID. Each `main.cpp` file contains the problem description in the beginning of the file as a comment.

## Compiling

Code containes no outside dependency and theoretically could be compiled with any compiler that supports minimum C++17. Tested with gcc on Windows and Linux.
